# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Omni!

Welcome to my profile!

## ðŸš€ Who am I?

I'm a programmer which knows Lua and I'm currently widening my knowledge in Python. I am trying to expand my skills and learn more programming languages as well.

## ðŸŒ± My Projects

Right now I'm making a program that is Python-based which uses Discord's API to do different tasks that adds convenience for the user. This project is my first project I plan to fully finish and consistently update, so keep an eye out for it!

## ðŸ“š My Goals

- **Complete Python**: Currently I am focusing on Python which will greatly help other projects in the future.
- **Go After Other Languages**: After Python, I will attempt to explore and learn more advanced programming languages in order to not only get more variety but also to improve and expand my portfolio.

## ðŸ’» My Expertises

- **Languages**: Lua and a decent understanding of Python!

Stay tuned for when I release my first and biggest project yet!
